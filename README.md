# üõ† Macadamy Backend Structure

This project uses Supabase with RPC-first design for secure, typed, and scalable backend operations.

The name **Macadamy** comes from the verb **"macadamize,"** which means _to pave a road with compacted layers of stone bound with asphalt_. Just as a macadamized surface provides a solid foundation for travel, Macadamy strives to lay the groundwork for streamlined construction management.


## ‚úÖ Key Design Principles
- All table reads use `get_*` RPCs with `SELECT ...` + optional `ST_AsText(...)` for WKT geometry
- All inserts/updates/deletes go through `insert_*`, `update_*`, `delete_*` RPCs with flexible JSONB inputs
- Frontend only handles clean, typed calls ‚Äî no direct `.from(...).update()` access
- All geometry is stored as WKT in PostGIS geometry columns and parsed on the frontend

## üì¶ Geometry Utilities
- `parseWktToGeoJson(wkt)` ‚Äî parses WKT ‚Üí GeoJSON
- `convertToGooglePath(geo)` ‚Äî converts GeoJSON ‚Üí Google Maps path format

## üîç Read RPCs (`get_*`)
- `get_all_line_item_templates`
- `get_all_profiles`
- `get_avatars_for_profile`
- `get_change_orders`
- `get_contract_organizations`
- `get_contract_with_wkt`
- `get_crew_members_by_organization`
- `get_crews_by_organization`
- `get_daily_logs`
- `get_equipment_assignments`
- `get_equipment_by_organization`
- `get_equipment_usage`
- `get_inspections`
- `get_issues`
- `get_labor_records(line_item_id uuid) -> LaborRecordsRow[]` - fetch labor records for a line item
- `get_job_titles`
- `get_line_item_entries`
- `get_line_item_templates_by_organization`
- `get_line_items_with_wkt`
- `get_maps_with_wkt`
- `get_organizations`
- `get_profiles_by_contract`
- `get_profiles_by_organization`
- `get_user_contracts`
- `get_wbs_with_wkt`

## ‚úèÔ∏è Write RPCs
- Each editable table includes:
  - `insert_<table>`
  - `update_<table>`
  - `delete_<table>`
  - `insert_labor_record(line_item_id uuid, worker_count integer, hours_worked numeric, work_date date, work_type text, notes text?) -> uuid`
  - `update_labor_record(id uuid, worker_count?, hours_worked?, work_date?, work_type?, notes?) -> void`
  - `delete_labor_record(id uuid) -> void`

## üóÑ Database Tables
The backend schema was recently overhauled. It now spans dozens of tables to
support accounting, HR, field operations, document management, and more. Below
is the full list of tables after the revamp:

```
accounts_payable          accounts_receivable       activity_logs
asphalt_types             audit_logs                avatars

user_projects             vendor_bid_packages       vendor_contacts
vendor_documents          vendor_qualifications     vendors
wbs                       workflows
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Tips
- Add new columns? Just update RPCs ‚Äî frontend stays untouched
- Need WKT parsing? Always handle in frontend using `parseWktToGeoJson`
- Use composite keys carefully (e.g. `user_contracts` needs `user_id + contract_id` for delete)
- Outdated profile contract RPCs were removed from `rpc.client.ts`
- New `ProjectsSection` and `OrganizationDashboard` components support project and organization views
- Project-related pages now live in `src/pages/Projects` (previously `Contract`)
- Shared layout components (`Page`, `PageContainer`, `SectionContainer`) live in `src/components/Layout.tsx`
- `FeatureListPage` simplifies our feature pages. Find it in `src/components/FeatureListPage.tsx`
- `useProjectsData` and `useOrganizationsData` hooks provide searchable data for dashboards
- New feature pages `QualitySafety` and `SubcontractorManagement` outline future compliance and vendor management modules
- Added `Payments` page to list project payments

This structure gives you a true API-less, secure backend with full control and complete type safety.

- Drone & sensor data integration
- Regulatory compliance tracking
- 3rd-party app integrations

## üß© Custom Hooks

- `useLocationSuggestions(query)` ‚Äì returns an array of location names from OpenStreetMap based on the query. Useful for building autocomplete inputs so user-entered locations are standardized.

## üêû Error Logging

Call `initGlobalErrorLogger()` during startup to capture uncaught errors and promise rejections. Logs include the error message and stack trace for easier debugging, and a toast notification alerts users that something went wrong.

## üêõ Troubleshooting Authentication
If you see an error like `error running hook URI: pg-functions://postgres/public/custom-access-token_hook` during sign-in, the database function for custom access tokens may be missing.
Run the migrations to recreate it:
```bash
npx supabase db reset
```
This applies `supabase/migrations/20250708223500_update_access_token_hook.sql` so authentication works.
