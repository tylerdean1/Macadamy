# publicOG Audit Notes (Phase 2)

(Notes will be added here during the file-by-file audit passes.)

### .codex/setup.sh
- What it is: Codex environment setup shell script.
- Why it exists: Initializes tooling for automated runs.
- Is it needed? YES (evidence: used by Codex/automation workflows).
- If it’s bloat: how to prove it can be removed safely (commands, build steps, references): Confirm no tooling references; remove and re-run automated tasks.
- Where referenced (imports/scripts/config) OR “not referenced found yet”: not referenced found yet (manual usage likely).
- Recommendation: KEEP
- Notes on improvements / tuning (if applicable): Add usage comment header.

### .env
- What it is: Local environment variables file.
- Why it exists: Stores secrets/config for local development.
- Is it needed? YES (evidence: referenced by app env validation; local dev).
- If it’s bloat: how to prove it can be removed safely (commands, build steps, references): Remove and attempt dev run; expect failures for missing envs.
- Where referenced (imports/scripts/config) OR “not referenced found yet”: not referenced found yet (convention-based).
- Recommendation: KEEP
- Notes on improvements / tuning (if applicable): Ensure .env is excluded from git if it contains secrets.

### .git (bulk summary)
- Total files: 1877
- Total bytes: 46828542
- Why it exists: Git repository metadata (history, refs, configuration).
- Should be committed: NO, unless publicOG is intentionally a nested Git repo (evidence: git metadata should live only at repo root).
- Cleanup recommendation: If publicOG is not meant to be a nested repo, remove the .git folder from publicOG; if it is a nested repo, keep but exclude from audits and treat as separate repo.

### .git/objects (bulk summary)
- Total files: 1839
- Total bytes: 46722640
- Why it exists: Git internal object database.
- Should be committed: NO (evidence: git objects are regenerated by git; should not be copied into another repo).
- Cleanup recommendation: Do not analyze per-file; if nested repo is accidental, delete .git/objects along with .git and re-clone or reinitialize.

### node_modules (bulk summary)
- Total files: 85951
- Total bytes: 403332248
- Why it exists: Installed npm dependencies.
- Should be committed: NO (evidence: standard practice; typically excluded in .gitignore and regenerated via package-lock).
- Cleanup recommendation: Delete node_modules and reinstall with npm install; ensure .gitignore excludes node_modules.

### dist (bulk summary)
- Total files: 70
- Total bytes: 3582896
- Why it exists: Build output artifacts.
- Should be committed: DEPENDS (evidence: check .gitignore and build/release workflow).
- Cleanup recommendation: If not required for deployment, remove dist and add to .gitignore; regenerate with npm run build when needed.
